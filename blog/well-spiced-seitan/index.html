<li>Recipe needs pictures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the Sietan Chicken recipe in
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cookin-Crunk-Eating-Vegan-Dirty/dp/1570672687">Cookin Crunk</a> by
<a href="https://vegancrunk.blogspot.com/">Bianca Phillips</a></p>
<p>We make a lot of seitan in our house, and with this recipe, we think you will too. This recipe
includes a lot more seasonings than your average seitan, which means it's jam packed with flavor and
won't require much additional seasoning when you cook with it later.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Dry</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tsp Chili Flakes</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Marash pepper (from Zingerman's)</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Urfa Pepper (from Zingerman's)</li>
<li>light dash Allspice powder</li>
<li>8 turns of Whole Cumin seed in a pepper grinder, or 1/8th tsp ground cumin</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp Fennel Seed chopped</li>
<li>1 tsp Onion powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Garlic powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Paprika</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Porcini Mushroom powder, or Morel Mushroom powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Chili powder</li>
<li>1/2 small Shallot minced (can substitute dried minced onion)</li>
<li>1/3 cup Chickpea Flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup Nutritional Yeast</li>
<li>1 cup Vital Wheat Gluten</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup water, minus 1 tbsp</li>
<li>1 tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
</ul>
<h3>Broth</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 and 3/4 cup water</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Better Than Boulion vegetable broth</li>
<li>Several cranks of cracked black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl and whisk.</li>
<li>Add all wet ingredients to a measuring cup.</li>
<li>Add wet ingredients to dry, and stir with a fork until compltely combined, no dry flours should
be present.</li>
<li>Knead with your hands, in the bowl, for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Let dough sit for half an hour to develop flavor.</li>
<li>While dough is sitting prep broth by mixing Better than Boulion and cracked pepper into water.</li>
<li>After dough has rested bring broth to a boil.</li>
<li>Once broth is boiling tear half inch chunks of dough off and place into broth.</li>
<li>Once all of your dough is in the boiling broth reduce heat to medium low and cover.</li>
<li>Every 5 minutes or mix your seitan the pot so the stuff on the bottom is on the top.</li>
<li>After about 40 minutes your broth should be mostly absorbed into your seitan. Turn heat off and
uncover your seitan.</li>
<li>Get two bowls out, one larger than the other. Put a cup or two of ice in the large bowl and add
several cups of water. Place the smaller bowl in the large bowl.</li>
<li>Add your cooked seitan to the smaller bowl and mix around. Let it sit for several minutes then
mix more. Repeat until cooled to room temperature.</li>
<li>Put cooled seitan into a tupperware container and put in fridge to cool further.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The seasonings in this recipe are all optional, change them to your taste. This is the taste
profile I like, you might like something else. What's important is that you like the flavor of your
seitan, not that you're following a recipe. You can also use less seasoning, but I like my seitan to
be jam packed with flavor so I don't need to season it later, I just chop it, cook it, and eat it.</li>
<li>Instead of tearing the seitan dough into small chunks you can just form it into a small brick and
boil it in one piece. In my experience I've needed a bit more water when doing this, which means
more broth mixture.</li>
</ul>
